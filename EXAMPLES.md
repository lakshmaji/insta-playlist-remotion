# Examples & Use Cases

## Example: Frontend Developer Learning Path

This example demonstrates how to use the bookmark manager to organize a learning path for becoming a frontend developer.

### 1. Create the Category Structure

```
📁 Become Frontend Developer
  ├─ 📁 Learn HTML
  ├─ 📁 Learn CSS
  ├─ 📁 Learn JavaScript
  │   ├─ 📁 Learn ReactJS
  │   ├─ 📁 Learn WebSocket
  │   └─ 📁 Learn Vue.js
  └─ 📁 Build Projects
```

### 2. Add Bookmarks to Categories

**Under "Learn HTML":**
- [MDN HTML Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
- [HTML Best Practices](https://github.com/hail2u/html-best-practices)

**Under "Learn CSS":**
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/)
- [Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)

**Under "Learn JavaScript":**
- [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/)
- [You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS)

**Under "Learn ReactJS":**
- [React Official Docs](https://react.dev) - Tags: `react, javascript, frontend`
- [React Tutorial](https://react.dev/learn) - Tags: `react, tutorial`

### 3. Create Associated Todos

**Under "Learn HTML":**

### 4. Track Your Progress

- Mark bookmarks as "Reading" when you start
- Mark as "Completed" when done
- Check off todos as you complete them
- Add new bookmarks as you discover resources

## Example: Research Project Organization

```
📁 Machine Learning Research
  ├─ 📁 Papers
  │   ├─ 📁 Computer Vision
  │   └─ 📁 NLP
  ├─ 📁 Datasets
  └─ 📁 Code Examples
```

Add bookmarks with tags like:
- `paper, cv, 2023` for computer vision papers
- `dataset, nlp` for NLP datasets
- `github, tensorflow` for TensorFlow examples

## Example: Job Search

```
📁 Job Search
  ├─ 📁 Company Research
  ├─ 📁 Interview Prep
  │   ├─ 📁 Coding Problems
  │   ├─ 📁 System Design
  │   └─ 📁 Behavioral
  └─ 📁 Applied Companies
```

Track status:
- "Unread" - Not reviewed yet
- "Reading" - Currently preparing
- "Completed" - Interview done
- "Archived" - No longer relevant

## Tips for Effective Organization

1. **Use Descriptive Category Names**: Make them clear and specific
2. **Tag Consistently**: Use lowercase, consistent tag names
3. **Add Descriptions**: Help yourself remember why you saved it
4. **Regular Cleanup**: Archive or delete outdated bookmarks
5. **Export Regularly**: Backup your data using JSON export
6. **Use Todos for Goals**: Break down learning goals into actionable items
7. **Leverage Search**: Use search for quick access instead of deep nesting

## Import Your Existing Bookmarks

1. Export from your browser (Chrome/Firefox/Safari)
2. Click "Import / Export"
3. Select HTML format
4. Choose your exported file
5. Organize into categories after import
6. Add tags and todos to enhance organization
